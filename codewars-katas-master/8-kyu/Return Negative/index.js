  Title:
    Return Negative

  Description:
    In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative.
    But maybe the number is already negative?

  Examples:
    makeNegative(1); // return -1
    makeNegative(-5); // return -5
    makeNegative(0); // return 0

  Notes:
    The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
    Zero (0) can't be negative, see examples above.
