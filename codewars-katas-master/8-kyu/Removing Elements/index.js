  Title:
    Removing Elements

  Description:
    Take an array and remove every second element out of that array.
    Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

  Examples:
    myArr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...];

  Notes:
    None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
