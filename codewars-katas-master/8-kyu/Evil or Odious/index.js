    The number n is Odious if it has an odd number of 1's in its binary expansion.
    First ten: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19

// Long Solution
/*
const evil = n => {
  const total = n
    .toString(2)
    .split('')
    .reduce((total, binary) => total + Number(binary), 0)

  return total % 2 === 0 ? "It's Evil!" : "It's Odious!"
}
*/

// Short Solution
const evil = n =>
  n.toString(2).match(/1/g).length % 2 ? "It’s Odious!" : "It’s Evil!"

// Function Export
module.exports = evil
