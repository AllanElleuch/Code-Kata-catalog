  Title:
    Invert values

  Description:
    Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

  Examples:
    invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
    invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
    invert([]) == []

  Notes:
    You can assume that all values are integers.
