  Title:
    Find the unique number

  Description:
    There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

    Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

  Examples:
    findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
    findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55

  Notes:
    The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
