  Title:
    The Hashtag Generator

  Description:
    The marketing team are spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
    Let's help them with out own Hashtag Generator!

    Here's the deal:
    * If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
    * If the input is a empty string it must return false.
    * It must start with a hashtag (#).
    * All words must have their first letter capitalized.

  Examples:
    " Hello there thanks for trying my Kata" => "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
    " Hello World " => "#HelloWorld"
