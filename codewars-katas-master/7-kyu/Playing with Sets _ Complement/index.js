  Title:
    Playing with Sets : Complement

  Description:
    Set objects are new JavaScript built-in objects defined since ECMAScript 2015

    A Set lets you store unique values of any type. It comes with some useful methods like .add, .clear, .has . . . BUT some "Set operations" are missing, like . . .

    Complement
    Two sets can be "subtracted". The relative complement of B in A, denoted by A \ B (or A − B), is the set of all elements that are members of A but not members of B. Note that it is valid to "subtract" members of a set that are not in the set, such as removing the element green from the set {1, 2, 3}; doing so has no effect.

    Examples:
      {1, 2} \ {1, 2} = ∅.
      {1, 2, 3, 4} \ {1, 3} = {2, 4}.

    Task
    Create function diff getting 2 sets as arguments and returning a new Set as result of relative complement of second set in first.

  Examples:
    A = new Set([1,2]);
    B = new Set([2,3]);

    diff(A,B) // -> {1}
    diff(B,A) // -> {3}

// Long Solution
const diff = (s1, s2) => new Set([...s1].filter((element) => !s2.has(element)))

// Function Export
module.exports = diff
