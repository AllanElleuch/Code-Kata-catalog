  Title:
    Lost number in number sequence

  Description:
    An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given.
    One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed.
    Find the number that was deleted.

  Examples:
    - The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    - The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
    - Your function should return the int 5.

  Notes:
  - If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it, your function should return the int 0.
  - Note that N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).
