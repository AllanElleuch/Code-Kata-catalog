  Title:
    Find the middle element

  Description:
    As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

    The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

  Example:
    gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0
    2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

    Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

    gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1
    10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.

// Long Solution
function gimme(inputArray) {
  const originalArray = [...inputArray]
  inputArray.sort((current, next) => current - next)

  return originalArray.indexOf(inputArray[1])
}

// Function Export
module.exports = gimme
