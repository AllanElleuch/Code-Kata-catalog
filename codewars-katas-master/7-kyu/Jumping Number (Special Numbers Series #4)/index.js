// Long Solution
/*
const jumpingNumber = n => {
  const numbers = [...String(n)]
  const allAdjacentsDiffersByOne = numbers.every((num, index, array) => {
    if (index === array.length - 1) return true

    const actualNumber = Number(num)
    const nextNumber = Number(array[index + 1])

    return actualNumber === nextNumber + 1 || actualNumber === nextNumber - 1
  })

  return allAdjacentsDiffersByOne ? 'Jumping!!' : 'Not!!'
}
*/

// Short Solution
const jumpingNumber = n =>
  [...String(n)].every((number, index, array) => index === 0 || Math.abs(number - array[index - 1]) === 1)
    ? 'Jumping!!'
    : 'Not!!'
