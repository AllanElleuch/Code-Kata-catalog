  Title:
    Remove the noise from the string

  Description:
    We have a broken message machine that introduces noise to our incoming messages. We know that our messages can't be written using %$&/#·@|º\ª and white characters (like spaces or tabs). Unfortunately our machine introduces noise, which means that our message arrives with characters like: %$&/#·@|º\ª within our original message.

    Your mission is to write a function which removes this noise from the message.

        Notice that noise can only be
        %$&/#·@|º\ª
        charaters, other characteres are not considered noise

  Examples:
    removeNoise("h%e&·%$·llo w&%or&$l·$%d")
    // returns hello world
