  Title:
    Find the calculation type

  Description:
    You have to create a function which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).
    Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.

    The possible return strings are:
      "addition",
      "subtraction",
      "multiplication",
      "division".

  Examples:
    calcType(1, 2, 3) -->   1 ? 2 = 3   --> "addition"

  Notes:
    In case of division you should expect that the result of the operation is obtained by using / operator on the input values - no manual data type conversion or rounding should be performed.
    Cases with just one possible answers are generated.
    Only valid arguments will be passed to the function.

// Long Solution
/*
 const calcType = (a, b, result) => {
  if (a + b === result) return 'addition'
  if (a - b === result) return 'subtraction'
  if (a * b === result) return 'multiplication'
  if (a / b === result) return 'division'
}
*/

// Short Solution
const calcType = (a, b, result) =>
  ({
    [a + b]: 'addition',
    [a - b]: 'subtraction',
    [a * b]: 'multiplication',
    [a / b]: 'division',
  }[result])

// Function Export
module.exports = calcType
