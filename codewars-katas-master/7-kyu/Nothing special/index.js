  Title:
    Nothing special

  Description:
    The notorious Captain Schneider has given you a very straight forward mission.
    Any data that comes through the system make sure that only non-special characters see the light of day.

    Create a function that given a string, retains only the letters A-Z (upper and lowercase), 0-9 digits, and whitespace characters.
    Also, returns "Not a string!" if the entry type is not a string.
