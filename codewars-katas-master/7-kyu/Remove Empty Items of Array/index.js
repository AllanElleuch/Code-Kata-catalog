  Title:
    Remove Empty Items of Array

  Description:
    In this Kata, you will learn how to remove all empty items in an Array.
    In JavaScript, empty items in arrays can be declared by [1, 2,,,3, 4] (Multiple commas without a value in that index)

    The values that are not given a value are empty items, and usually add up with others to form <# empty items>;
    In the example, <2 empty items>
    [1, 2, <2 empty items>, 3, 4] should be cleared such that it should be [1, 2, 3, 4]

    Examples:
    Before: [1, 2, 3, <5 empty items>, 4, <1 empty item>, null, undefined];
    After: [1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined];
