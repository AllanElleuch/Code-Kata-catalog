  Title:
    Covfefe

  Description:
    Your are given a string. You must replace the word(s) coverage by covfefe,
    however, if you don't find the word coverage in the string,
    you must add covfefe at the end of the string with a leading space.

    For the languages where the string is not immutable (such as ruby),
    don't modify the given string, otherwise this will break the test cases.
